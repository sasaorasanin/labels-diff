# Language Labels Comparison Tool

A simple web-based tool to compare language labels and identify differences between two sets of key-value pairs. Built with HTML, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS, this tool is useful for developers working on localization to find missing translations between two languages.

## Features
- Compare two sets of language labels in `key=value` format.
- Displays labels present in one language but missing in the other.
- Responsive design with a modern UI using Tailwind CSS.
- Smooth scrolling to results for better user experience.
- Lightweight and dependency-free (uses Tailwind CSS via CDN).

## Demo
Try the tool by opening `index.html` in a browser. Enter labels in the format `key=value` (one per line) in the two input textareas, then click "Find Difference" to see the results.

**Example Input**:
- **First Language**:
  ```
  home=Home
  settings=Settings
  profile=Profile
  ```
- **Second Language**:
  ```
  home=Poƒçetna
  profile=Profil
  ```

**Output**:
- **First Language Missing in Second**: `settings=Settings`
- **Second Language Missing in First**: (empty)

   Then visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

## Usage
1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. In the "First Language Labels" textarea, enter labels for the first language (e.g., `key=value`, one per line).
3. In the "Second Language Labels" textarea, enter labels for the second language.
4. Click the **Find Difference** button.
5. View the results in the two output textareas:

   - Labels present in the second language but missing in the first.
6. The page will automatically scroll to the results.
